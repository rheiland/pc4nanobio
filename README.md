A cancer tumor undergoing nanotherapy simulator. This app can be run at https://nanohub.org/tools/pc4nanobio.

Synthetic biology and other bioengineering techniques are increasingly creating novel compounds that can target and tune specific aspects of cell phenotype (behavior), such as proliferation, adhesion, motility, and metabolism. This presents both key opportunities and challenges: What if we could tune what a therapeutic does, and where it is delivered? Which therapies would be worth delivering? What are the key design parameters? 

The aim of this tool is to explore these what if questions: users can set nanoparticle, tissue, cell, and drug response parameters for a growing tumor, and see for themselves how things could play out for their design choices.
